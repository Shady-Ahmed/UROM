# UROM
Python implementation of uplifted reduced order modeling (UROM) framework for the paper: 

### ["A long short-term memory embedding for hybrid uplifted reduced order models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06756) by Shady E. Ahmed, Omer San, Adil Rasheed, and Traian Iliescu.

Includes two test cases; 1D viscous Burgers problem, and 2D vortex merger problem.
Each case has a a folder that contains field data generation, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), Galerkin projection, training long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for UROM as well as fully nonintrusive reduced order model (NIROM), and testing of the three discussed frameworks, namely GROM, NIROM, and UROM.
